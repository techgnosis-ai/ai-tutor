        {
            "question": "What is biology?",
            "answer": "Biology is the science that studies life."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why is it difficult to define life?",
            "answer": "It is difficult to define life because some entities, like viruses, exhibit some characteristics of living entities but lack others, leading to debates within the biological community."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the three main questions biology has wrestled with since its beginnings?",
            "answer": "The three main questions are: What makes something \u201calive\u201d? How do we find meaningful levels of organization in its structure? How do we organize different kinds of organisms to better understand the diversity of life?"
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the key characteristics or functions shared by all living organisms?",
            "answer": "The key characteristics shared by all living organisms are order, sensitivity or response to stimuli, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation/homeostasis, energy processing, and evolution."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do organisms demonstrate the characteristic of sensitivity or response to stimuli?",
            "answer": "Organisms demonstrate this characteristic by responding to diverse stimuli, such as plants bending toward light or bacteria moving toward or away from chemicals (chemotaxis) or light (phototaxis)."
        },
        {
            "question": "What role does adaptation play in the survival and evolution of organisms?",
            "answer": "Adaptation is a fit to the environment resulting from evolution by natural selection, enhancing reproductive potential and survival, and allowing organisms to track environmental changes."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is homeostasis maintained in organisms?",
            "answer": "Homeostasis is maintained through regulatory mechanisms that coordinate internal functions, like nutrient transport and blood flow, and ensure stable internal conditions despite environmental changes."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the significance of the phylogenetic tree constructed by Carl Woese?",
            "answer": "Carl Woese's phylogenetic tree is significant because it used genetic data to show the separation of living organisms into three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, revolutionizing our understanding of life's evolutionary relationships."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the levels of organization among living things, from simplest to most complex?",
            "answer": "The levels of organization are atoms, molecules, macromolecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems, and the biosphere."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are some examples of subdisciplines within biology?",
            "answer": "Examples of subdisciplines within biology include molecular biology, microbiology, neurobiology, paleontology, zoology, botany, biotechnology, ecology, and physiology."
