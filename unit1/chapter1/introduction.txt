By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Identify the shared characteristics of the natural sciences
• Summarize the steps of the scientific method
• Compare inductive reasoning with deductive reasoning
• Describe the goals of basic science and applied science

INTRODUCTION Viewed from space, Earth offers no clues about the diversity of life forms that reside
there. Scientists believe that the first forms of life on Earth were microorganisms that existed for billions
of years in the ocean before plants and animals appeared. The mammals, birds, and flowers so familiar
to us are all relatively recent, originating 130 to 250 million years ago. The earliest representatives of the
genus Homo, to which we belong, have inhabited this planet for only the last 2.5 million years, and only
in the last 300,000 years have humans started looking like we do today.
